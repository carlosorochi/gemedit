{"name":"Gemedit","body":"by Lee Marlow and [contributors](https://github.com/lmarlow/gemedit/contributors)\r\n\r\n![http://travis-ci.org/lmarlow/gemedit](http://travis-ci.org/lmarlow/gemedit.png)\r\n\r\n## DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nGemedit lets you quickly open up the source for a gem in your favorite editor.\r\n\r\nLooking through other people's code is a great way to learn.  I often use it\r\nwhen a gem's RDoc isn't as helpful as I'd like or just want to see how someone\r\nput a library together.  Gemedit just makes it easier to get to the code.\r\n\r\n## INSTALLATION:\r\n\r\nGemedit is installed via RubyGems and is available as a gem command:\r\n\r\n  `$ gem install gemedit`\r\n\r\n## USAGE:\r\n\r\nIf you want to see how gemedit works just install it and run this:\r\n\r\n  `$ gem edit gemedit`\r\n\r\nGemedit tries to use your favorite editor from your `$GEMEDITOR`,\r\n`$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` environment variable.  It will fall back\r\nto _everyone's_ favorite editor: *vi*.  You can specify the editor with\r\nthe `-e/--editor` switch.  Run this to view the source for +rake+ in\r\n[TextMate](http://macromates.com):\r\n\r\n  `$ gem edit -e mate rake`\r\n\r\nAnd of course, help is available:\r\n```\r\n  $ gem edit -h\r\n  $ gem edit --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n## SOURCE REPOSITORY:\r\n\r\nThe source is currently on [github](https://github.com/) at\r\nhttps://github.com/lmarlow/gemedit. Feel free to fork it and submit pull\r\nrequests.\r\n\r\n  `$ git clone https://github.com/lmarlow/gemedit.git`\r\n","tagline":"Gemedit lets you quickly open up the source for a gem in your favorite editor.","google":"UA-729069-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
